                    <h2>My Bio</h2>
                    <p>My name is Daniel Alexandre, I am 18 years old and a freshman at New England Institute of Technology majoring in computer science. I was born on 9/11/2004, in Boston Massachusetts, shortly there after my family moved back to Paris, France to be closer to my fathers family. At 5 years old we moved back to the states, where i lived in Quincy, Mass, and later Wrenthem, Mass.</p>
                    <p>In highschool, I trained in 2 sports including Swimming and Volleyball and was able to participate in both on a Varsity level and as Captain. While figuring out what i wanted to major in for college, i chose the IT route because ive always grown up with and loved using computers, and so I decidied to try it out, so far so good!</p>
