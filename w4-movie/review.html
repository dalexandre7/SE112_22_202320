            <h2>REVIEW</h2>
            <p><b>Daniel Alexandre</b> <i>Febuary 10, 2023</i></p>
            <p><i>Interstellar</i> is definitivly one of the best Sci-fi movies to date. The dystopic future the movie pants encapsulates the audience from the first couple of minutes of the movie. In addtion, the movie maintains a great balence between building the plot <b>and</b> the characters, 
            because of this we as the audience feel as though we are with the crew on their intergalactic space mission and share their emotions.(Its a tearjerker for sure)</p>
            <p>One of the most notable parts of the movie include its cinematography, the movie contains some of the most impressive CGI of the twenty-first century, from the black-hole, to other planets, and more this movie will not disaapoint in its production quality. This adds to its realisim and keeps
                us as viewers glued to the screen even with an above average runtime.
            </p>

                        The black hole depicted in the movie is accurate, and may be the most scientfically accurate 3D model we have so far as it took <b>100 hours per frame</b> to render the calculations into video.
